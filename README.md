# Job Hunt

[Live Demo](https://job--hunting.herokuapp.com/)

Job Hunt allows you to stay organized through the job application process.

Create an entry for every job application you've submitted. Each entry will contain information about the job such as title, company name, location, date applied, estimated salary, URL to job posting, and any additional notes.

Each column represents a stage in the interview process. Drag and drop each entry to the corresponding stage.

Create, edit, or delete entries or columns at any time.

Visualize your data with a charting interface.
